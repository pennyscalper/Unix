Some useful unix commands

//((for running grep))
tail -f | grep
//((its an interactive command to go over a file))
less 
//((sort by characters
 tr -sc 'A-Za-z' '\n' < tmpStory.txt | sort | uniq -c | less 
//((sort by count))
tr -sc 'A-Za-z' '\n' < tmpStory.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r | less 
//((sort by count after converting the upper letter to lower))
tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' < tmpStory.txt | tr -sc 'A-Za-z' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r | less 

//search words ending in ing
 tr -sc 'A-Za-z' '\n' < tmpStory.txt | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | grep 'ing$' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r | less

//search words ending in ing but only with a vowel before 'ing. here . means anything and * means one or more
tr -sc 'A-Za-z' '\n' < tmpStory.txt | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | grep '[aeiou].*ing$' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r | less


//Example tr - remove carriage returns:
tr -d '\r' < dosfile.txt > unixfile.txt

//Create files for demonstration: takes input untill EOF is encountered and then puts it in to the file
cat << EOF > dummy_file1.dat

//diff two files
diff dummy_file1.dat dummy_file2.dat

//Example 1 of paste - lines from multiple files: for displaying output side by side
paste dummy1.txt dummy2.txt grocery.list


//basic calculator
$ echo 2+3|bc
$ echo 3*3+2|bc
$ VAR1=$(echo 2^8|bc)
$ echo $VAR1
$ echo "(1+1)^8"|bc
printf "Percentage: %2.2f%%\n" $(echo .9963*100|bc)

//split to split up a big file into smaller files for processing. -l tells the maximum number of lines for each //output file. Also profvide prefix for the files
split -l 2000 tmpStory.txt tmpStory_

//cut; It cuts data by bytes (-b), characters (-c), or fields (-f) as specified by a list.
cat dummy_cut.dat |cut -f1- -d, -s

//uniq; list needs to be sorted. -c gives count as well. -d just shows the duplicated
cat dummy_uniq.dat | sort |uniq -d -c

//sort. run with -u will only show unique. -r is in reverese; -n will sort in numeric order and not alphabetic. -f ignores case
$cat << EOF > dummy_sort1.dat
014 VMW, 102.92
013 INTC, 22.69
012 sap,  59.37
011 IBM, 174.99
011 IBM, 174.99

EOF
$sort -u dummy_sort1.dat

//join. -t specifies the delimiter. -j species the field on which join to be made(default is 1st column)
